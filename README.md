# businessautomationchatbot

This project is a complete AI-powered RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chatbot built with FastAPI and FLAN-T5. It can intelligently answer questions based on your own knowledge base or object file (like JSON, TXT, or CSV). The backend handles text embedding using SentenceTransformers and retrieves the most relevant information before generating accurate and natural responses. The frontend, built with HTML and Tailwind CSS, provides a simple and clean chat interface where users can interact with the bot in real time. The project folder includes all necessary files: app.py for backend logic, data/kb.json as a sample knowledge base, web/index.html for the UI, requirements.txt for dependencies, and a README.md file with setup instructions. To run the project, open it in VS Code, install the dependencies with pip install -r requirements.txt, then launch the app using uvicorn app:app --reload. Finally, open the web/index.html file in your browser to start chatting with your intelligent assistant. This project is ideal for anyone who wants to create a personalized chatbot that answers questions based on their own data — perfect for AI, research, or automation use cases.
